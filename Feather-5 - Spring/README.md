# PCB files for the LooUQ Circuit River Feather-5 Spring 

The LooUQ Circuit River Feather-5 Spring device enables a quick and seemless connection between a Feather form development board (such as Adafruit Feather M0 Express, Adafruit Feather M4 Express, or the SparkFun SAMD51 Things Plus) and any of the LooUQ Circuit River Stream wireless communications circuit boards, when your project also needs a flexible power source. The Feather-5 requires a 5-volt DC DC power source. If you need more flexible power options, consider our Feather-630 Spring that can operate on an input voltage range of 6-volts to 30-volts.

The Feather-5 Spring is designed to fit neatly in a [Polycase LP-35F](https://www.polycase.com/lp-35f) or unflanged LP-35P. We left you some room to stuff some sensor or other logic in there too.
